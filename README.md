I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard using the sales sample.csv dataset. The process involved:

1) Cleaning and importing the data into Power BI.

2) Creating DAX measures for Total Sales and Profit and Orders.

3) Building three main pages:

..Sales Overview (KPIs, time trends, top customers)

..Product Performance (sales by product line, top items)

..Geographic Insights (sales by country, state, and city)

4) Adding slicers for interactivity.

5) Exporting key visuals to a PowerPoint summary.

This dashboard offers a clear view of performance trends and supports informed business decisions through visual storytelling and interactivity.
